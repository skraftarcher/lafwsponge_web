Welcome to the Louisiana Freshwater Sponge Hunters page! 
<br>
<br>
The Louisiana Freshwater Sponge Project was started by Dr. Mary Miller and a group
of interns,in the Summer of 2019. The project was a follow up from the original survey that was conducted by Dr. Michael Poirrier in 1968. 
<br>
<br>
The project is now shared between two institutions:
<br>
<br>
Baton Rouge Community College, still led by Dr. Miller and 
Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, led by Dr. Stephanie Archer. The two have continued to collaborate with Dr. Poirrier to identify sponges and answer
questions related to these environmental health indicators.
<br>
<br>
This project is designed to bring awareness of freshwater sponges, continuously survey Louisiana water systems, and share our finding with the public.
